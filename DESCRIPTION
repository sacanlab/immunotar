Description: To address the challenge of identifying and systematically prioritizing
  immunotherapeutic targets computationally, we developed ImmunoTar. This tool integrates
  multiple publicly available databases, analyzes cancer expression datasets, and
  quantitively prioritizes potential targets based on predefined ideal immunotherapeutic
  target criteria. In addition to adult derived databases, ImmunoTar is equipped with
  pediatric specific databases aiming to aid in identifying pediatric-specific antigens,
  providing a resource for developing novel therapies in pediatric oncology.

Comment1: Packages fgsea and ComplexHeatmap are also required, but they are not listed
  as a package dependency due to a limitation in the R installer. These packages will
  be installed from BioConductor when they are needed at run-time.
DevComment1: Only modify the copy present in the src.r/ folder. It will be automatically
  copied and override the copy in the R package folder.
DevComment2: You do not need to list the Imports above manually. running packager_makepackage()
  will automatically add the required packages to the list.
